# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

In this project, I explored the concept of packing and code distribution in a sofware project. I learnt about dynamic libraries, how they work, how to create one, and how to use it. I learnt about the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it. I can now tell the differences between static and shared libraries.
